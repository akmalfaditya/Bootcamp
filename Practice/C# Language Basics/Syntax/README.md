# C# Syntax Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
In this project, you'll learn the fundamental building blocks that every C# developer needs to know. Think of this as learning the alphabet before writing poetry.

## What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts Covered:

1. **Identifiers and Keywords**
   - Understanding what makes a valid identifier
   - C# reserved keywords and how to escape them
   - Naming conventions (PascalCase, camelCase)

2. **Comments and Documentation**
   - Single-line comments (`//`)
   - Multi-line comments (`/* */`)
   - XML documentation comments (`///`)

3. **Literals and Basic Types**
   - Numeric literals (int, double, decimal)
   - String literals and escape sequences
   - Boolean literals (true/false)
   - Character literals

4. **Operators and Expressions**
   - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
   - Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, etc.)
   - Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
   - Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)

5. **Variables and Constants**
   - Variable declaration and initialization
   - Constant declarations with `const`
   - Readonly fields vs constants

## Tips

> **Pro Tip**: Good naming conventions aren't just about following rules - they make your code self-documenting. When you see `customerAge` vs `ca`, which one tells you more about the purpose?

> **Remember**: Keywords like `namespace`, `class`, `int` are reserved, but you can use them as identifiers by prefixing with `@` (e.g., `@namespace`). However, this is rarely a good idea in practice!

## What to Focus On

1. **Consistency**: Pick a naming style and stick with it
2. **Readability**: Your code should tell a story
3. **Best Practices**: Start building good habits early

## üèÉRun the Project

```bash
dotnet run
```

This will demonstrate all the syntax concepts in action. Pay attention to the console output and try to understand how each piece of syntax contributes to the program's behavior.
