# C# Numeric Types

This project provides a comprehensive overview of numeric types in C#, which are fundamental for mathematical calculations, financial applications, and scientific computing. Understanding the characteristics and appropriate usage of each numeric type is essential for effective C# programming.

## Objectives

This demonstration explores the various numeric data types available in C#, their characteristics, limitations, and best practices for their usage in different scenarios.

## Core Concepts

The following essential topics are covered in this project:

### 1. Integral Types

Integral types are fundamental data types that represent whole numbers without decimal or fractional components. They form the backbone of most counting, indexing, and discrete mathematical operations in C# applications.

**Signed Integer Types:**
Signed integer types can represent both positive and negative values, making them suitable for calculations that may result in negative numbers.

- **`sbyte`**: 8-bit signed integer
  - Range: -128 to 127
  - Memory usage: 1 byte
  - Use case: Storing small signed values where memory conservation is critical

- **`short`**: 16-bit signed integer
  - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
  - Memory usage: 2 bytes
  - Use case: Moderate-range values in memory-constrained environments

- **`int`**: 32-bit signed integer
  - Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
  - Memory usage: 4 bytes
  - Use case: Default choice for most integer operations, counters, and identifiers

- **`long`**: 64-bit signed integer
  - Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  - Memory usage: 8 bytes
  - Use case: Large numbers such as timestamps, file sizes, and high-precision calculations

**Unsigned Integer Types:**
Unsigned integer types can only represent non-negative values (zero and positive numbers), effectively doubling the positive range compared to their signed counterparts.

- **`byte`**: 8-bit unsigned integer
  - Range: 0 to 255
  - Memory usage: 1 byte
  - Use case: Binary data, color values, network protocols

- **`ushort`**: 16-bit unsigned integer
  - Range: 0 to 65,535
  - Memory usage: 2 bytes
  - Use case: Port numbers, Unicode code points

- **`uint`**: 32-bit unsigned integer
  - Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295
  - Memory usage: 4 bytes
  - Use case: Array indices, hash codes, system identifiers

- **`ulong`**: 64-bit unsigned integer
  - Range: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
  - Memory usage: 8 bytes
  - Use case: Very large positive values, cryptographic operations

**Range and Storage Considerations:**
The choice of integral type directly impacts memory usage and determines the range of values that can be represented. Selecting an appropriate type requires balancing memory efficiency with the expected range of values in your application.

**Overflow Behavior:**
When arithmetic operations result in values that exceed the type's range, overflow occurs. By default, C# allows overflow to wrap around silently, which can lead to unexpected results. Understanding and controlling this behavior is crucial for creating reliable applications.

### 2. Floating-Point Types

Floating-point types are designed to represent real numbers that include fractional components. These types use the IEEE 754 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic, which allows for the representation of very large and very small numbers with varying degrees of precision.

**`float` (Single-Precision):**
The `float` type is a 32-bit floating-point representation that provides approximately 7 decimal digits of precision.

**Characteristics:**
- Memory usage: 4 bytes
- Precision: Approximately 7 significant decimal digits
- Range: ±1.5 × 10^-45 to ±3.4 × 10^38
- Suffix: `F` or `f` (e.g., `3.14F`)
- Performance: Fastest floating-point type

**Use Cases:**
- Graphics and game development where performance is prioritized over precision
- Scientific calculations with moderate precision requirements
- Applications where memory usage is a primary concern

**`double` (Double-Precision):**
The `double` type is a 64-bit floating-point representation that provides approximately 15-17 decimal digits of precision.

**Characteristics:**
- Memory usage: 8 bytes
- Precision: Approximately 15-17 significant decimal digits
- Range: ±5.0 × 10^-324 to ±1.7 × 10^308
- Suffix: `D` or `d` (optional, as it's the default for decimal literals)
- Performance: Good balance between precision and speed

**Use Cases:**
- Scientific and engineering calculations requiring high precision
- Mathematical algorithms and statistical computations
- Default choice for most floating-point operations

**`decimal` (High-Precision Decimal):**
The `decimal` type is a 128-bit decimal floating-point representation specifically designed for financial and monetary calculations where exact decimal representation is required.

**Characteristics:**
- Memory usage: 16 bytes
- Precision: 28-29 significant decimal digits
- Range: ±1.0 × 10^-28 to ±7.9228 × 10^28
- Suffix: `M` or `m` (e.g., `19.99M`)
- Performance: Slowest among floating-point types but provides exact decimal representation

**Use Cases:**
- Financial applications requiring exact decimal calculations
- Currency and monetary computations
- Applications where rounding errors from binary floating-point representation are unacceptable

**Precision and Accuracy Considerations:**
Understanding the precision limitations of each floating-point type is crucial for choosing the appropriate type for your application. The binary representation used by `float` and `double` can introduce small rounding errors in decimal calculations, while `decimal` uses base-10 representation to avoid these issues for decimal numbers.

### 3. Numeric Literals

Numeric literals are the syntactic representations of numeric values directly written in source code. C# provides multiple formats for expressing numeric values, each serving different purposes and improving code readability in various contexts.

**Decimal Notation:**
Decimal notation represents numbers in the familiar base-10 system. This is the most common and intuitive way to express numeric values.

```csharp
int basicNumber = 123;
int largeNumber = 1000000;
int readableNumber = 1_000_000;  // Digit separators for improved readability
```

**Digit Separators:**
C# allows the use of underscores as digit separators to improve the readability of large numbers. These separators are ignored by the compiler and serve purely as visual aids for developers.

**Hexadecimal Notation:**
Hexadecimal notation uses base-16 representation with the prefix `0x` or `0X`. This format is commonly used in low-level programming, bit manipulation, and when working with memory addresses or color values.

```csharp
int hexValue = 0xFF;        // Equivalent to 255 in decimal
int colorValue = 0xFF_AA_BB; // RGB color representation with separators
int memoryAddress = 0x1A2B3C4D;
```

**Binary Notation:**
Binary notation uses base-2 representation with the prefix `0b` or `0B`. This format is particularly useful when working with bit flags, binary operations, or when the binary representation of a value is conceptually important.

```csharp
int binaryValue = 0b1010;           // Equivalent to 10 in decimal
int flags = 0b1111_0000_1010_0101;  // Bit flags with separators for clarity
byte mask = 0b1100_0000;            // Bit mask for specific operations
```

**Scientific Notation:**
Scientific notation (exponential notation) allows for the compact representation of very large or very small numbers using the format `mantissa e exponent`.

```csharp
double largeNumber = 1.23e6;    // 1.23 × 10^6 = 1,230,000
float smallNumber = 2.5e-4F;    // 2.5 × 10^-4 = 0.00025
decimal scientific = 1.5e10M;   // 1.5 × 10^10 = 15,000,000,000
```

**Literal Formatting Best Practices:**
- Use digit separators for numbers with more than four digits to improve readability
- Choose the appropriate notation based on the context and domain of your application
- Use hexadecimal for bit manipulation, memory addresses, and color values
- Use binary notation when the bit pattern is conceptually important
- Use scientific notation for very large or very small numbers in scientific applications

### 4. Type Suffixes and Inference

C# uses a sophisticated type inference system to determine the appropriate numeric type for literals, while also providing explicit suffixes to override the default behavior when specific types are required.

**Literal Type Determination:**
When the compiler encounters a numeric literal without an explicit suffix, it follows a specific set of rules to determine the most appropriate type:

**Integer Literal Inference Rules:**
1. The compiler first attempts to fit the value into an `int`
2. If the value is too large for `int`, it tries `uint`
3. If still too large, it tries `long`
4. Finally, if necessary, it uses `ulong`

```csharp
var small = 100;           // Inferred as int
var large = 3000000000;    // Inferred as uint (too large for int)
var veryLarge = 5000000000L; // Explicitly long due to L suffix
```

**Floating-Point Literal Inference:**
- Literals with decimal points are inferred as `double` by default
- Scientific notation literals are also inferred as `double`
- Explicit suffixes are required for `float` and `decimal` types

**Explicit Type Suffixes:**
Suffixes provide precise control over literal types, ensuring that values are assigned to the intended numeric type without relying on inference.

**Integer Suffixes:**
- `L` or `l`: Forces long type (prefer uppercase `L` for clarity)
- `UL` or `ul`: Forces unsigned long type
- `U` or `u`: Forces unsigned int type

```csharp
long timestamp = 1609459200L;     // Explicit long
uint identifier = 4000000000U;    // Explicit uint
ulong bigValue = 10000000000UL;   // Explicit ulong
```

**Floating-Point Suffixes:**
- `F` or `f`: Forces float type
- `D` or `d`: Forces double type (optional, as double is default)
- `M` or `m`: Forces decimal type

```csharp
float precision = 3.14159F;       // Explicit float
double standard = 3.14159;        // Inferred as double
decimal money = 19.99M;           // Explicit decimal
```

**Type Safety Considerations:**
Using appropriate suffixes ensures that literals match their intended types, preventing potential precision loss or compilation errors. This is particularly important when:
- Working with method overloads that accept different numeric types
- Performing calculations where precision requirements are specific
- Interfacing with APIs that expect exact numeric types
- Avoiding implicit conversions that might introduce performance overhead

**Best Practices for Suffixes:**
- Always use `M` suffix for decimal literals in financial calculations
- Use `F` suffix for float literals to avoid double-to-float conversion warnings
- Use `L` suffix for long literals that exceed int range
- Be consistent with suffix casing throughout your codebase (prefer uppercase for better visibility)

### 5. Numeric Conversions

Numeric conversions allow values to be transformed from one numeric type to another, enabling interoperability between different numeric types while maintaining type safety and controlling potential data loss.

**Implicit Conversions (Widening Conversions):**
Implicit conversions occur automatically when the target type can accommodate all possible values from the source type without any risk of data loss. The compiler performs these conversions automatically without requiring explicit syntax.

**Characteristics of Implicit Conversions:**
- No explicit cast syntax required
- Guaranteed to preserve all information
- No runtime exceptions can occur
- Generally involve converting from smaller to larger types

**Common Implicit Conversion Paths:**
```csharp
// Integer widening conversions
sbyte sb = 10;
short s = sb;    // sbyte to short
int i = s;       // short to int
long l = i;      // int to long

// Unsigned integer conversions
byte b = 255;
ushort us = b;   // byte to ushort
uint ui = us;    // ushort to uint
ulong ul = ui;   // uint to ulong

// Integer to floating-point conversions
int intValue = 42;
float floatValue = intValue;    // int to float
double doubleValue = intValue;  // int to double
decimal decimalValue = intValue; // int to decimal
```

**Explicit Conversions (Narrowing Conversions):**
Explicit conversions require explicit cast syntax and may result in data loss or runtime exceptions. These conversions are used when converting from larger to smaller types or between incompatible types.

**Characteristics of Explicit Conversions:**
- Require explicit cast syntax using parentheses
- May result in data loss or truncation
- Can throw exceptions in checked contexts
- Programmer assumes responsibility for safety

**Common Explicit Conversion Scenarios:**
```csharp
// Narrowing integer conversions
long longValue = 1000000000000;
int intValue = (int)longValue;  // May lose data if longValue > int.MaxValue

// Floating-point to integer conversions
double doubleValue = 123.456;
int truncated = (int)doubleValue;  // Results in 123 (fractional part lost)

// Between floating-point types
double preciseValue = 3.141592653589793;
float lessPreci
se = (float)preciseValue;  // May lose precision
```

**Overflow Checking:**
C# provides mechanisms to control how arithmetic operations behave when they result in values that exceed the target type's range.

**Checked Context:**
The `checked` keyword enables overflow checking for arithmetic operations and conversions, causing `OverflowException` to be thrown when overflow occurs.

```csharp
checked
{
    int maxValue = int.MaxValue;
    int overflow = maxValue + 1;  // Throws OverflowException
}

// Checked can also be applied to expressions
int result = checked(int.MaxValue + 1);
```

**Unchecked Context:**
The `unchecked` keyword explicitly disables overflow checking, allowing arithmetic operations to wrap around silently.

```csharp
unchecked
{
    int maxValue = int.MaxValue;
    int wrapped = maxValue + 1;  // Results in int.MinValue (wraps around)
}
```

**Conversion Safety Best Practices:**
- Use explicit conversions only when you understand the potential for data loss
- Implement validation logic before performing narrowing conversions
- Use checked contexts in scenarios where overflow detection is critical
- Consider using safe conversion methods like `Convert.ToInt32()` with exception handling
- Document the intended behavior when explicit conversions are necessary

**Performance Considerations:**
- Implicit conversions generally have minimal performance impact
- Explicit conversions may involve additional processing overhead
- Checked arithmetic operations have performance implications due to overflow detection
- Consider the frequency of conversions in performance-critical code paths

    Console.WriteLine($"Double == 0.3: {doubleValue == 0.3}"); // False
    
    // Decimal precision (exact for decimal numbers)
    decimal decimalValue = 0.1m + 0.2m;
    Console.WriteLine($"Decimal: {decimalValue}");          // 0.3
    Console.WriteLine($"Decimal == 0.3m: {decimalValue == 0.3m}"); // True
}
```

{
    public void DemonstrateSafeConversions()
    {
        // Safe implicit conversions
        int intValue = 42;
        long longValue = intValue;        // Safe: int fits in long
        double doubleValue = intValue;    // Safe: int fits in double
        decimal decimalValue = intValue;  // Safe: int fits in decimal

        }
    }
    
    public void DemonstrateCheckedArithmetic()
    {
        // Checked context for overflow detection
        try
        {
            checked
            {
                int maxInt = int.MaxValue;
                int overflow = maxInt + 1;  // Throws OverflowException

            Console.WriteLine($"Wrapped value: {wrapped}");
        }
    }
}

## Professional Development Guidelines

### Type Selection Strategy

**Decision Matrix for Numeric Types:**

**For Integer Values:**
- Use `int` as the default choice for most integer operations
- Choose `long` when values may exceed int range or for high-precision calculations
- Select `byte` for binary data manipulation and memory-efficient storage
- Use `uint` and `ulong` only when the non-negative constraint provides meaningful benefits

**For Decimal Values:**
- Use `decimal` for financial calculations, currency, and exact decimal representation
- Choose `double` for scientific calculations and general-purpose floating-point operations
- Select `float` only when memory usage is critical and precision requirements are modest

**Performance Considerations:**

**Computational Efficiency:**
Understanding the performance characteristics of different numeric types helps in making informed decisions for performance-critical applications.

**Performance Hierarchy (Fastest to Slowest):**
1. `int` - Optimal for most processors, fastest arithmetic operations
2. `long` - Slightly slower than int on 32-bit systems, fast on 64-bit systems
3. `double` - Efficient floating-point operations, hardware-accelerated
4. `float` - Fast but may require conversion overhead when mixed with double
5. `decimal` - Slowest due to software-based decimal arithmetic

**Memory Usage Optimization:**
- Consider array and collection sizes when choosing types for large datasets
- Balance precision requirements with memory constraints
- Use appropriate types for loop counters and array indices

### Error Prevention Strategies

**Overflow Protection:**
```csharp
public class OverflowSafeOperations
{
    public static int SafeAdd(int a, int b)
    {
        checked
        {
            return a + b;  // Throws OverflowException if overflow occurs
        }
    }
    
    public static bool TryAdd(int a, int b, out int result)
    {
        try
        {
            result = checked(a + b);
            return true;
        }
        catch (OverflowException)
        {
            result = 0;
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

**Precision-Aware Calculations:**
```csharp
public class PrecisionSafeCalculations
{
    // Financial calculations with decimal precision
    public static decimal CalculateCompoundInterest(decimal principal, decimal rate, int periods)
    {
        decimal result = principal;
        for (int i = 0; i < periods; i++)
        {
            result *= (1 + rate);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    // Scientific calculations with appropriate precision
    public static double CalculateDistance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
    {
        double dx = x2 - x1;
        double dy = y2 - y1;
        return Math.Sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }
}
```

    {
        decimal periodicRate = annualRate / compoundingPeriods;
        decimal totalPeriods = compoundingPeriods * years;
        
        return principal * (decimal)Math.Pow((double)(1 + periodicRate), (double)totalPeriods);
    }
}
```

**Performance-Critical Calculations:**
```csharp
public class GraphicsCalculations
{
    public static float DistanceSquared(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2)
    {
        float dx = x2 - x1;
        float dy = y2 - y1;
        return dx * dx + dy * dy; // Avoid expensive square root when possible
    }
}
```

## Critical Development Considerations

### Error Prevention Strategies

**Practices to Avoid:**
- **Avoid using `float` for financial calculations** due to binary floating-point precision limitations that can introduce rounding errors in decimal calculations
- **Do not ignore integer overflow** in applications where accuracy is critical, particularly in financial, scientific, or safety-critical systems
- **Avoid mixing `float` and `double`** without understanding the precision implications and potential conversion overhead
- **Do not use `double` for exact decimal calculations** where precision in decimal representation is required

**Recommended Practices:**
- **Select numeric types based on precision requirements** rather than solely on performance considerations
- **Implement `checked` contexts** for arithmetic operations in overflow-sensitive code paths
- **Use explicit type suffixes** when working with numeric literals where type precision is important
- **Understand and document** the performance implications of your numeric type choices, especially in high-frequency operations

### Advanced Considerations

**Thread Safety and Atomic Operations:**
```csharp
public class AtomicCounter
{
    private long _count;
    
    public long Increment()
    {
        return Interlocked.Increment(ref _count);
    }
    
    public long Value => Interlocked.Read(ref _count);
}
```

**Memory Layout Optimization:**
```csharp
// Struct layout considerations for performance
[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Pack = 1)]
public struct OptimizedCoordinate
{
    public float X;
    public float Y;
    public float Z;
    // Packed structure reduces memory footprint
}
```
