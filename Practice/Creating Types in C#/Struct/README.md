# C# Structs - Value Types and Performance

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of C# structs and their unique characteristics as value types. You will learn how to design efficient structs, understand their behavior differences from classes, and apply them appropriately in real-world scenarios.

**What you will master:**
- Understanding value type semantics versus reference type semantics
- Creating efficient structs for small, immutable data structures
- Implementing readonly structs and readonly methods for immutability
- Working with ref structs for stack-only memory allocation scenarios
- Understanding struct constructor and initialization rules
- Optimizing performance through proper struct design patterns
- Making informed decisions about when to use structs versus classes

## Core Concepts Covered

This project explores seven fundamental aspects of C# structs through practical examples and demonstrations.

### 1. Value Type Semantics

Structs are value types, which means they exhibit fundamentally different behavior from reference types (classes). Understanding these differences is crucial for effective struct usage.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Copy Behavior**: When you assign a struct to another variable, the entire struct is copied, not just a reference
- **Stack Allocation**: Struct instances are typically allocated on the stack rather than the heap
- **No Shared References**: Multiple variables cannot reference the same struct instance
- **Implicit Default Constructor**: All structs have an implicit parameterless constructor that initializes all fields to their default values

**Example Demonstration:**
```csharp
BasicPoint p1 = new BasicPoint(10, 20);
BasicPoint p2 = p1;  // Copies the entire struct
p2.X = 30;           // Only affects p2, p1 remains unchanged
        Y = y;
    }
}

// Value semantics - copying behavior
Point point1 = new Point(10, 20);
Point point2 = point1;  // Creates a complete copy
point2.X = 99;

Console.WriteLine($"point1.X = {point1.X}"); // Still 10!
Console.WriteLine($"point2.X = {point2.X}"); // Now 99

// Each variable contains its own copy of the data
```

This behavior contrasts with reference types where assignment copies only the reference, allowing multiple variables to point to the same object.

### 2. Constructor Behavior and Initialization

Structs have specific rules for constructors and field initialization that differ from classes.

**Constructor Rules:**
- **Implicit Parameterless Constructor**: Always available and cannot be removed or redefined (prior to C# 10)
- **Custom Parameterless Constructor**: Available from C# 10 onwards, allowing custom default initialization
- **Field Initialization**: All fields must be initialized before the constructor completes
- **Field Initializers**: Direct field initialization is supported from C# 10 onwards

**Modern Constructor Features (C# 10+):**
```csharp
public struct ModernPoint
{
    public int X = 1;    // Field initializer
    public int Y = 1;    // Field initializer
    
    public ModernPoint() // Custom parameterless constructor
    {
        X = 5;
        Y = 5;
    }
}
```

### 3. Readonly Structs and Methods

Readonly structs enforce immutability at the compiler level, providing both safety and performance benefits.

**Readonly Struct Benefits:**
- **Immutability**: All fields are implicitly readonly, preventing modification after creation
- **Performance**: Eliminates defensive copying when passing to readonly contexts
- **Thread Safety**: Immutable structs are inherently thread-safe
- **Compiler Optimizations**: The compiler can make additional optimizations for readonly structs

**Implementation Example:**
```csharp
public readonly struct Color
{
    public readonly byte R;
    public readonly byte G;
    public readonly byte B;
    
    public Color(byte r, byte g, byte b)
    {
        R = r;
        G = g;
        B = b;
    }
    
    // All methods are implicitly readonly
    public string ToHex() => $"#{R:X2}{G:X2}{B:X2}";
}
```

### 4. Ref Structs (Stack-Only Types)

Ref structs are a special category of structs that can only exist on the stack, providing zero-allocation scenarios for performance-critical code.

**Ref Struct Characteristics:**
- **Stack-Only Allocation**: Cannot be allocated on the heap
- **No Boxing**: Cannot be converted to object or interface types
- **No Generic Type Arguments**: Cannot be used as generic type parameters
- **No Async Methods**: Cannot be used in async method contexts
- **No Yield Return**: Cannot be used in iterator methods

**Use Cases:**
- High-performance scenarios requiring zero allocations
- Temporary data structures for calculations
- Interop scenarios with unmanaged memory
- Stack-based parsing operations

**Example Implementation:**
```csharp
public ref struct StackOnlyPoint
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
    
    public StackOnlyPoint(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }
}
```

### 5. Inheritance Limitations and Interface Implementation

Structs have specific limitations regarding inheritance but can implement interfaces.

**Inheritance Constraints:**
- **No Class Inheritance**: Structs cannot inherit from classes or other structs
- **Sealed Nature**: Structs are implicitly sealed and cannot be used as base types
- **Value Type Base**: All structs implicitly inherit from System.ValueType

**Interface Implementation:**
- Structs can implement any number of interfaces
- Interface method calls may cause boxing if not handled carefully
- Generic constraints can help avoid boxing when working with struct interfaces

### 6. Performance Analysis and Optimization

Understanding the performance characteristics of structs is essential for making informed design decisions.

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Size Matters**: Keep structs small (typically under 16 bytes) for optimal performance
- **Copy Costs**: Large structs are expensive to copy; consider using ref parameters
- **Boxing Overhead**: Avoid boxing by using generic constraints and proper interface design
- **Memory Layout**: Structs have predictable memory layout for better cache performance

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Use readonly structs to prevent defensive copying
- Pass large structs by reference to avoid copying overhead
- Design immutable structs for thread safety and predictability
- Consider ref structs for temporary, high-performance scenarios

### 7. Practical Use Cases and Design Patterns

This project demonstrates several real-world scenarios where structs provide optimal solutions.

**Ideal Struct Use Cases:**
- **Coordinate Systems**: Points, vectors, and geometric data
- **Color Representations**: RGB, HSL, and other color models
- **Financial Data**: Money amounts with currency information
- **Mathematical Values**: Complex numbers, fractions, measurements
- **Configuration Values**: Settings and options that behave like values
- **Time Representations**: Durations, ranges, and time-related data

**Design Patterns:**
- **Immutable Value Objects**: Using readonly structs for unchanging data
- **Factory Methods**: Static methods for creating commonly used instances
- **Operator Overloading**: Mathematical and comparison operations
- **Equatable Implementation**: Proper equality comparison for value semantics

## Best Practices and Guidelines

### When to Use Structs
- Data represents a single value or small collection of related values
- Data is immutable or rarely changes
- Size is small (generally under 16 bytes)
- Value semantics are desired over reference semantics
- Performance is critical and allocations should be minimized

### When to Use Classes Instead
- Data is large or complex
- Data is frequently modified
- Reference semantics are needed
- Inheritance is required
- The type will be used polymorphically

### Design Recommendations
- Make structs immutable when possible using readonly modifier
- Override Equals, GetHashCode, and ToString methods
- Implement IEquatable&lt;T&gt; for better performance
- Use meaningful names that reflect the value nature of the data
- Keep struct size small to avoid expensive copy operations
- Consider using ref parameters for large structs to avoid copying

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Boxing and Performance Issues
- Avoid casting structs to object or non-generic interfaces
- Use generic constraints to maintain struct performance
- Be careful with collection operations that may cause boxing

### Mutability Problems
- Avoid mutable structs as they can lead to confusing behavior
- Understanding that modifying a copied struct doesn't affect the original
- Be cautious when storing structs in collections and modifying them

### Constructor and Initialization Issues
- Remember that structs always have a default constructor
- Ensure all fields are properly initialized in custom constructors
- Understand the differences between C# versions regarding parameterless constructors
