# TDD Project Completion Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Unit Testing with NUnit - Prime Number Service

### 🎯 Project Status: **COMPLETE**

This comprehensive TDD project has been successfully completed, demonstrating the full Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

### 📊 Final Results
- **Total Tests**: 78
- **Passing Tests**: 78 (100%)
