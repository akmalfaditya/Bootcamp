# Automatic Garbage Collection in C#

This project provides a comprehensive hands-on demonstration of how automatic garbage collection works in .NET. It covers all the essential concepts developers need to understand to write memory-efficient C# applications.

## Learning Objectives

After exploring this project, you will understand:

- How object lifecycles work in managed memory
- The concept of roots and object reachability
- How generational garbage collection improves performance
- Why circular references don't cause memory leaks in .NET
- How to monitor memory usage programmatically
- The behavior of the Large Object Heap (LOH)
- What triggers garbage collection
- How weak references work and when to use them

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have .NET 8.0 or later installed
2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
3. **Run the demonstration**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

The program will execute 9 different demonstrations, each focusing on a specific aspect of garbage collection.

## Demonstration Overview

### 1. Object Lifecycle and Memory Allocation
**Concept**: Understanding how objects are created, live, and become eligible for collection.

**What it shows**:
- Memory allocation when objects are created
- How local variables keep objects alive
- When objects become eligible for collection (when they go out of scope)
- Memory reclamation through garbage collection

**Key Insight**: Objects become eligible for collection when no more references point to them.

### 2. Roots and Reachability
**Concept**: The garbage collector traces from "roots" to determine which objects are still needed.

**What it shows**:
- How root references keep object chains alive
- Creating "orphaned" objects with no root references
- How removing root references makes entire object graphs eligible for collection

**Key Insight**: The GC uses a "mark and sweep" approach, starting from roots (local variables, static fields, etc.) and marking all reachable objects. Unreachable objects are collected.

### 3. Generational Garbage Collection
**Concept**: .NET uses a generational GC that divides objects into generations based on age.

**What it shows**:
- Creation of short-lived objects (Generation 0)
- Creation of long-lived objects that survive multiple collections
- How objects promote from Gen 0 → Gen 1 → Gen 2
- Different collection frequencies for each generation

**Key Insight**: Most objects die young, so the GC focuses on Gen 0 for performance. Older objects (Gen 1, Gen 2) are collected less frequently.

### 4. Circular References
**Concept**: Objects that reference each other in a circle don't prevent garbage collection.

**What it shows**:
- Creating objects with circular references (A → B → C → A)
- How the tracing GC correctly identifies unreachable circular structures
- Memory reclamation despite circular references

**Key Insight**: Unlike reference counting GC, .NET's tracing GC can handle circular references correctly.

### 5. Memory Monitoring
**Concept**: How to programmatically monitor memory usage and understand the impact of allocations.

**What it shows**:
- Using `Process` class to monitor working set and private memory
- Using `GC.GetTotalMemory()` to track managed memory
- Impact of large allocations on memory usage
- Memory reclamation after garbage collection

**Key Insight**: Understanding different types of memory measurements helps with performance monitoring and optimization.

### 6. Large Object Heap (LOH)
**Concept**: Objects ≥85KB are allocated on a special heap with different collection characteristics.

**What it shows**:
- Difference between small objects (regular heap) and large objects (LOH)
- LOH objects are only collected during Generation 2 collections
- Performance implications of large object allocations

**Key Insight**: Large objects are more expensive to collect, so minimize unnecessary large allocations.

### 7. Memory Pressure and GC Triggers
**Concept**: Understanding what causes the garbage collector to run.

**What it shows**:
- How rapid allocation creates memory pressure
- Automatic triggering of Generation 0 collections
- Collection frequency patterns under memory pressure

**Key Insight**: The GC automatically runs when memory pressure builds up - you don't need to (and shouldn't) call it manually.

### 8. Weak References
**Concept**: References that don't keep objects alive but can access them if they're still around.

**What it shows**:
- Creating weak references alongside strong references
- How removing strong references allows collection even with weak references present
- Checking if weak reference targets are still alive

**Key Insight**: Weak references are useful for caches and event observers that shouldn't prevent cleanup.

### 9. Finalization and Disposal Patterns
**Concept**: Understanding the relationship between garbage collection and finalization, and the proper implementation of disposal patterns.

**What it shows**:
- Objects with finalizers require two GC cycles to be fully collected
- The overhead added by finalizers to garbage collection performance
- Proper implementation of IDisposable pattern
- Benefits of calling Dispose() explicitly vs relying on finalization
- Use of GC.SuppressFinalize() to avoid unnecessary finalizer overhead

**Key Insight**: Always implement IDisposable for deterministic cleanup and call GC.SuppressFinalize() in Dispose() to avoid the performance penalty of finalization.

## Supporting Classes

### SampleObject
A demonstration class that includes:
- Memory allocation to make GC effects visible
- Reference to other objects for building object graphs
- Helper methods for creating object hierarchies
- Finalizer for demonstrating cleanup timing

### CircularReferenceObject
A specialized class for circular reference demonstrations:
- References to other instances of the same class
- Methods for creating and analyzing circular chains
- Safe traversal that avoids infinite loops
- Functionality to break circular references manually

### FinalizationExample
A comprehensive class demonstrating finalization and disposal patterns:
- Implements both IDisposable and finalization
- Shows the proper dispose pattern implementation
- Demonstrates the overhead of finalization
- Includes methods for comparing disposal vs finalization performance
- Simulates both managed and unmanaged resource cleanup

### GCMonitor
A utility class for advanced garbage collection monitoring:
- Captures snapshots of GC state at specific points in time
- Compares GC states to analyze the impact of operations
- Monitors actions and generates detailed impact reports
- Provides comprehensive memory and collection statistics

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't call GC.Collect() manually** - The GC is optimized and knows when to run
2. **Understand object lifetimes** - Keep references only as long as needed
3. **Be mindful of large objects** - They have different collection characteristics
4. **Circular references are OK** - .NET's GC handles them correctly
5. **Monitor memory usage** - Use built-in tools to understand your application's memory patterns
6. **Weak references are powerful** - Use them for caches and event subscriptions
7. **Implement IDisposable properly** - Always call GC.SuppressFinalize() in Dispose()
8. **Avoid finalizers when possible** - They add significant overhead to GC
9. **Use 'using' statements** - Ensure deterministic cleanup of resources


## Notes

This code is written with extensive comments explaining the "why" behind each demonstration. The comments are written in a teaching style, explaining concepts rather than just describing what the code does.

**Important**: This demonstration code includes manual calls to `GC.Collect()` for educational purposes only. In production code, these calls should be avoided as they can hurt performance.
