# Asynchronous Patterns Demo

This project demonstrates the essential asynchronous patterns in .NET that are crucial for building robust, responsive applications. It covers the key concepts needed to effectively manage asynchronous operations, handle cancellation, report progress, and combine multiple asynchronous tasks.

## Fundamental Concepts and Learning Objectives

### 1. Cancellation Patterns

#### The Problem
Long-running operations need to be cancellable to maintain application responsiveness and prevent resource waste. Users should be able to cancel operations, and applications should implement timeouts for operations that might hang indefinitely.

#### The Solution: CancellationToken and CancellationTokenSource
The .NET Framework provides a formalized approach to cancellation through two primary types:

**CancellationTokenSource**: Responsible for initiating cancellation requests. It provides the `Cancel()` method and can be configured with automatic timeout periods.

**CancellationToken**: A lightweight struct that represents the cancellation state. It provides methods like `IsCancellationRequested` and `ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` to check and respond to cancellation requests.

#### Key Principles
- **Cooperative Cancellation**: Operations must actively check for cancellation requests
- **Exception Propagation**: Cancelled operations throw `OperationCanceledException`
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of resources even when operations are cancelled
- **Timeout Support**: Automatic cancellation after specified time periods

### 2. Progress Reporting Patterns

#### The Problem
Long-running operations should provide feedback to users about their progress. However, progress callbacks often execute on background threads, which can cause threading issues when updating UI elements.

#### The Solution: IProgress<T> and Progress<T>
The framework provides a thread-safe progress reporting mechanism:

**IProgress<T>**: A generic interface defining the `Report(T value)` method for publishing progress updates.

**Progress<T>**: A concrete implementation that automatically captures the current synchronization context, ensuring progress callbacks execute on the appropriate thread (typically the UI thread).

#### Key Benefits
- **Thread Safety**: Automatic marshalling to the correct thread
- **UI Responsiveness**: Safe UI updates from background operations
- **Flexible Data**: Generic type parameter allows custom progress information
- **Separation of Concerns**: Progress reporting logic is separated from business logic

### 3. Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)

#### The Standard Pattern
TAP is the recommended pattern for exposing asynchronous operations in .NET. It provides consistency across APIs and enables seamless integration with async/await.

#### TAP Characteristics
- **Return Type**: Methods return `Task` or `Task<TResult>`
- **Naming Convention**: Method names end with "Async"
- **Quick Return**: Methods return immediately after starting the asynchronous operation
- **Hot Tasks**: Returned tasks are already executing
- **Overloads**: Support for cancellation tokens and progress reporting

#### Integration with Language Features
TAP methods are designed to work seamlessly with C#'s async/await keywords, providing natural asynchronous programming patterns.

### 4. Task Combinators

#### Purpose and Power
Task combinators enable composition of multiple asynchronous operations without needing to understand the specifics of each individual task. They provide declarative control over complex asynchronous workflows.

#### Task.WhenAny
Returns a task that completes when **any** of the provided tasks completes. This is useful for:
- Implementing timeouts for operations that don't support cancellation
- Racing multiple operations and responding to the first result
- Providing fallback mechanisms

#### Task.WhenAll
Returns a task that completes when **all** provided tasks complete. This enables:
- Parallel execution of independent operations
- Efficient resource utilization
- Coordinated completion of multiple related tasks

#### Exception Handling
- **WhenAny**: Exceptions from the winning task are propagated directly
- **WhenAll**: Exceptions from all tasks are aggregated, with the first exception being thrown when awaited

## Detailed Concept Explanations

### 1. Understanding Cancellation Patterns

#### Cooperative Cancellation Model
The .NET cancellation system follows a cooperative model, meaning that the operation being cancelled must actively participate in the cancellation process. This is different from forceful termination where operations are abruptly stopped.

**Why Cooperative Cancellation?**
Cooperative cancellation ensures that:
- Resources are properly cleaned up before termination
- Data integrity is maintained during cancellation
- The application remains in a consistent state
- Custom cleanup logic can be executed

#### CancellationTokenSource Deep Dive
The `CancellationTokenSource` class serves as the control point for cancellation:

**Key Methods:**
- `Cancel()`: Initiates the cancellation process
- `CancelAfter(TimeSpan)`: Schedules automatic cancellation after a specified duration
- `CreateLinkedTokenSource()`: Creates hierarchical cancellation relationships

**Resource Management:**
CancellationTokenSource implements `IDisposable` and should be properly disposed to prevent resource leaks, especially when using timers for automatic cancellation.

#### CancellationToken Implementation Details
The `CancellationToken` struct provides the interface for checking cancellation state:

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Lightweight struct with minimal memory overhead
- Thread-safe operations for checking cancellation state
- Efficient polling mechanism for cancellation detection

**Exception Handling:**
When `ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` is called on a cancelled token, it throws `OperationCanceledException`, which is specifically designed for cancellation scenarios and is handled differently from other exceptions in the async pipeline.

#### Cancellation Propagation Chain
In complex applications, cancellation often needs to propagate through multiple layers:

```
User Request → HTTP Request Cancellation → Business Logic Cancellation → Database Operation Cancellation
```

Each layer should accept and forward cancellation tokens to maintain the cancellation chain.

### 2. Progress Reporting Architecture

#### Thread Synchronization Context
The key innovation of `Progress<T>` is its automatic capture of the synchronization context:

**UI Thread Marshalling:**
When created on a UI thread, `Progress<T>` automatically captures the UI synchronization context and ensures that progress callbacks execute on the UI thread, preventing cross-thread operation exceptions.

**ASP.NET Context:**
In ASP.NET applications, progress callbacks are marshalled back to the appropriate request context, maintaining proper execution context.

#### Progress Reporting Patterns
Different scenarios require different progress reporting approaches:

**Percentage-Based Progress:**
```csharp
IProgress<int> progress = new Progress<int>(percentage => 
    UpdateProgressBar(percentage));
```

**Detailed Progress Information:**
```csharp
IProgress<OperationProgress> progress = new Progress<OperationProgress>(info => 
    UpdateDetailedProgress(info.CurrentStep, info.TotalSteps, info.CurrentOperation));
```

**Hierarchical Progress:**
For complex operations with sub-operations, progress can be reported at multiple levels with appropriate scaling.

#### Performance Considerations
Progress reporting should be balanced between informativeness and performance:

**Reporting Frequency:**
- Too frequent: Can overwhelm the UI and degrade performance
- Too infrequent: Provides poor user experience
- Optimal: Report at meaningful milestones or at regular intervals (e.g., every 100ms)

**Callback Complexity:**
Progress callbacks should be lightweight to avoid blocking the reporting thread.

### 3. Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) Deep Dive

#### TAP Design Philosophy
TAP was designed with several key principles:

**Composability:**
TAP methods can be easily combined using async/await, task combinators, and continuation patterns.

**Efficiency:**
TAP methods are designed to be efficient for I/O-bound operations by not blocking threads during wait periods.

**Consistency:**
TAP provides a consistent programming model across all .NET asynchronous APIs.

#### TAP Method Signatures
Standard TAP method signatures follow predictable patterns:

**Basic Pattern:**
```csharp
Task<TResult> OperationAsync()
Task<TResult> OperationAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

**With Progress:**
```csharp
Task<TResult> OperationAsync(IProgress<TProgress> progress)
Task<TResult> OperationAsync(IProgress<TProgress> progress, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

#### Implementation Guidelines
When implementing TAP methods:

**Quick Return:**
The method should perform minimal synchronous work before returning the task. Heavy initialization should be part of the asynchronous operation.

**Exception Handling:**
Exceptions should be captured and stored in the returned task, not thrown synchronously from the method.

**State Management:**
TAP methods should not maintain state between calls; they should be stateless and thread-safe.

### 4. Task Combinators: Composition Patterns

#### Task.WhenAny Implementation Details
`Task.WhenAny` creates a task that completes when any of the input tasks complete:

**Completion Behavior:**
- Returns the first task to complete (success, failure, or cancellation)
- Other tasks continue running in the background
- The result is the winning task itself, not its result

**Exception Handling:**
- If the winning task is faulted, awaiting the result will throw the exception
- Non-winning tasks that fault later will have unobserved exceptions
- Applications should handle or observe all input tasks to prevent unobserved exceptions

**Resource Management:**
Care must be taken to properly manage resources from tasks that don't complete first.

#### Task.WhenAll Implementation Details
`Task.WhenAll` creates a task that completes when all input tasks complete:

**Completion Behavior:**
- Waits for all tasks to complete before returning
- Returns an array of results if all input tasks are `Task<T>`
- Continues execution of all tasks even if some fail

**Exception Aggregation:**
- Collects exceptions from all faulted tasks
- Throws the first exception when awaited
- All exceptions are available through the `Exception.InnerExceptions` property

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Enables true parallel execution
- Efficient resource utilization
- Optimal for independent operations

#### Advanced Combinator Patterns

**Timeout Implementation:**
```csharp
public static async Task<T> WithTimeout<T>(this Task<T> task, TimeSpan timeout)
{
    var timeoutTask = Task.Delay(timeout);
    var completedTask = await Task.WhenAny(task, timeoutTask);
    
    if (completedTask == timeoutTask)
        throw new TimeoutException();
    
    return await task;
}
```

**Retry Logic:**
```csharp
public static async Task<T> WithRetry<T>(this Func<Task<T>> taskFactory, int maxRetries)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++)
    {
        try
        {
            return await taskFactory();
        }
        catch when (i < maxRetries - 1)
        {
            // Continue with next retry
        }
    }
    
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Max retries exceeded");
}
```

### 5. Error Handling in Asynchronous Operations

#### Exception Propagation in Async Operations
Asynchronous operations have unique exception handling characteristics:

**Task Exception Storage:**
Exceptions in async operations are captured and stored in the task's `Exception` property rather than being thrown immediately.

**AggregateException Wrapping:**
When multiple operations fail simultaneously, exceptions are wrapped in an `AggregateException` to preserve all failure information.

**Async/Await Exception Unwrapping:**
The `await` keyword automatically unwraps the first exception from an `AggregateException` for cleaner catch blocks.

#### Exception Handling Best Practices

**Specific Exception Types:**
```csharp
try
{
    await operation();
}
catch (OperationCanceledException)
{
    // Handle cancellation
}
catch (HttpRequestException)
{
    // Handle network errors
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle unexpected errors
}
```

**Task State Examination:**
```csharp
if (task.IsFaulted)
{
    var baseException = task.Exception?.GetBaseException();
    // Handle based on exception type
}
```

### 6. Performance Optimization Strategies

#### Async Operation Efficiency
Efficient asynchronous operations consider:

**Thread Pool Usage:**
- Minimize thread pool thread consumption
- Use async I/O operations instead of blocking operations
- Avoid unnecessary task creation

**Memory Allocation:**
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Reuse objects where possible
- Use object pooling for frequently created objects

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Design for high concurrency
- Implement proper backpressure mechanisms
- Monitor resource usage and adjust accordingly

#### ConfigureAwait(false) Usage
In library code, use `ConfigureAwait(false)` to prevent deadlocks:

```csharp
public async Task<string> LibraryMethodAsync()
{
    var result = await SomeOperationAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
    return result;
}
```

This prevents the continuation from being scheduled on the original synchronization context.

### 7. Real-World Application Scenarios

#### Web Application Patterns
In web applications, these patterns enable:

**Scalable Request Processing:**
- Handle thousands of concurrent requests efficiently
- Implement proper cancellation when requests are aborted
- Provide progress feedback for long-running operations

**Database Operations:**
- Execute multiple database queries concurrently
- Implement proper timeout and retry logic
- Handle connection pool exhaustion gracefully

#### Desktop Application Patterns
In desktop applications, these patterns provide:

**Responsive User Interfaces:**
- Keep UI responsive during long operations
- Allow users to cancel operations in progress
- Provide meaningful progress feedback

**Background Processing:**
- Perform heavy computations without blocking the UI
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Manage system resources efficiently

#### Service Application Patterns
In service applications, these patterns enable:

**Graceful Shutdown:**
- Properly cancel ongoing operations during service shutdown
- Implement timeout mechanisms for cleanup operations
- Ensure data consistency during shutdown

**Parallel Processing:**
- Process multiple work items concurrently
- Implement proper load balancing and resource management
- Handle failures and retry logic appropriately

## Code Examples and Implementation Patterns

### 1. Basic Cancellation Implementation

#### Simple Cancellation Pattern
```csharp
public async Task LongRunningOperationAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        // Check for cancellation at regular intervals
        cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        
        // Simulate work
        await Task.Delay(100, cancellationToken);
        
        // Process item i
        ProcessItem(i);
    }
}
```

#### Cancellation with Resource Cleanup
```csharp
public async Task ProcessFileAsync(string filePath, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    using var fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open);
    using var reader = new StreamReader(fileStream);
    
    try
    {
        while (!reader.EndOfStream)
        {
            cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
            
            var line = await reader.ReadLineAsync();
            await ProcessLineAsync(line, cancellationToken);
        }
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        // Cleanup is handled by using statements
        // Log the cancellation if needed
        throw; // Re-throw to preserve cancellation semantics
    }
}
```

### 2. Progress Reporting Implementation

#### Basic Progress Reporting
```csharp
public async Task ProcessItemsAsync(IEnumerable<string> items, 
    IProgress<int> progress = null, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    var itemList = items.ToList();
    int totalItems = itemList.Count;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < totalItems; i++)
    {
        cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        
        // Process the item
        await ProcessSingleItemAsync(itemList[i], cancellationToken);
        
        // Report progress
        int percentComplete = (i + 1) * 100 / totalItems;
        progress?.Report(percentComplete);
    }
}
```

#### Advanced Progress Reporting with Custom Data
```csharp
public class DetailedProgress
{
    public string CurrentOperation { get; set; }
    public int ItemsProcessed { get; set; }
    public int TotalItems { get; set; }
    public int PercentComplete { get; set; }
    public TimeSpan ElapsedTime { get; set; }
    public TimeSpan EstimatedTimeRemaining { get; set; }
}

public async Task ProcessDataAsync(IEnumerable<DataItem> data, 
    IProgress<DetailedProgress> progress = null, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    var dataList = data.ToList();
    var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < dataList.Count; i++)
    {
        cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        
        var item = dataList[i];
        await ProcessDataItemAsync(item, cancellationToken);
        
        if (progress != null)
        {
            var elapsed = stopwatch.Elapsed;
            var percentComplete = (i + 1) * 100 / dataList.Count;
            var estimatedTotal = elapsed.TotalMilliseconds * dataList.Count / (i + 1);
            var estimatedRemaining = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(estimatedTotal - elapsed.TotalMilliseconds);
            
            progress.Report(new DetailedProgress
            {
                CurrentOperation = $"Processing {item.Name}",
                ItemsProcessed = i + 1,
                TotalItems = dataList.Count,
                PercentComplete = percentComplete,
                ElapsedTime = elapsed,
                EstimatedTimeRemaining = estimatedRemaining
            });
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. TAP Method Implementation

#### Basic TAP Method
```csharp
public async Task<string> DownloadStringAsync(string url)
{
    using var httpClient = new HttpClient();
    return await httpClient.GetStringAsync(url);
}
```

#### TAP Method with Full Support
```csharp
public async Task<ProcessResult> ProcessDataAsync(
    ProcessRequest request,
    IProgress<ProcessProgress> progress = null,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    // Validate parameters
    if (request == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(request));
    
    // Quick return - method returns immediately
    return await ProcessDataInternalAsync(request, progress, cancellationToken);
}

private async Task<ProcessResult> ProcessDataInternalAsync(
    ProcessRequest request,
    IProgress<ProcessProgress> progress,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var result = new ProcessResult();
    
    try
    {
        // Perform the actual work
        for (int i = 0; i < request.ItemCount; i++)
        {
            cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
            
            // Process item
            var itemResult = await ProcessSingleItemAsync(request.Items[i], cancellationToken);
            result.AddItem(itemResult);
            
            // Report progress
            progress?.Report(new ProcessProgress
            {
                ItemsProcessed = i + 1,
                TotalItems = request.ItemCount,
                CurrentItem = request.Items[i].Name
            });
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    catch (Exception ex) when (!(ex is OperationCanceledException))
    {
        // Log the exception
        result.AddError(ex);
        throw;
    }
}
```

### 4. Task Combinator Patterns

#### Parallel Processing with WhenAll
```csharp
public async Task<ProcessResult[]> ProcessMultipleDataSourcesAsync(
    IEnumerable<DataSource> dataSources,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    // Create tasks for each data source
    var processingTasks = dataSources.Select(async dataSource => 
    {
        try
        {
            return await ProcessDataSourceAsync(dataSource, cancellationToken);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Log exception for this data source
            return new ProcessResult { Error = ex };
        }
    }).ToArray();
    
    // Wait for all tasks to complete
    var results = await Task.WhenAll(processingTasks);
    
    return results;
}
```

#### Timeout Pattern with WhenAny
```csharp
public async Task<T> WithTimeoutAsync<T>(
    Task<T> task, 
    TimeSpan timeout, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    using var timeoutCts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(cancellationToken);
    timeoutCts.CancelAfter(timeout);
    
    var timeoutTask = Task.Delay(timeout, timeoutCts.Token);
    
    var completedTask = await Task.WhenAny(task, timeoutTask);
    
    if (completedTask == timeoutTask)
    {
        throw new TimeoutException($"Operation timed out after {timeout}");
    }
    
    return await task;
}
```

#### Retry Pattern with Exponential Backoff
```csharp
public async Task<T> WithRetryAsync<T>(
    Func<Task<T>> taskFactory,
    int maxRetries = 3,
    TimeSpan baseDelay = default,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    if (baseDelay == default)
        baseDelay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
    
    var exceptions = new List<Exception>();
    
    for (int attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++)
    {
        try
        {
            return await taskFactory();
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (attempt < maxRetries)
        {
            exceptions.Add(ex);
            
            // Exponential backoff
            var delay = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(baseDelay.TotalMilliseconds * Math.Pow(2, attempt));
            await Task.Delay(delay, cancellationToken);
        }
    }
    
    throw new AggregateException("Operation failed after retries", exceptions);
}
```

### 5. Error Handling Patterns

#### Comprehensive Error Handling
```csharp
public async Task<OperationResult> ProcessWithErrorHandlingAsync(
    ProcessRequest request,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    var result = new OperationResult();
    
    try
    {
        // Perform the operation
        var data = await FetchDataAsync(request.DataSource, cancellationToken);
        var processedData = await ProcessDataAsync(data, cancellationToken);
        var savedData = await SaveDataAsync(processedData, cancellationToken);
        
        result.Success = true;
        result.Data = savedData;
        
        return result;
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        result.Success = false;
        result.Error = "Operation was cancelled";
        result.ErrorType = OperationErrorType.Cancelled;
        
        // Don't log cancellation as an error
        return result;
    }
    catch (TimeoutException ex)
    {
        result.Success = false;
        result.Error = "Operation timed out";
        result.ErrorType = OperationErrorType.Timeout;
        result.Exception = ex;
        
        // Log timeout
        LogTimeout(request, ex);
        
        return result;
    }
    catch (ValidationException ex)
    {
        result.Success = false;
        result.Error = "Invalid data provided";
        result.ErrorType = OperationErrorType.Validation;
        result.Exception = ex;
        
        // Log validation error
        LogValidationError(request, ex);
        
        return result;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        result.Success = false;
        result.Error = "Unexpected error occurred";
        result.ErrorType = OperationErrorType.Unexpected;
        result.Exception = ex;
        
        // Log unexpected error
        LogUnexpectedError(request, ex);
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### 6. Performance Optimization Patterns

#### Efficient Resource Management
```csharp
public async Task<ProcessResult> ProcessLargeDatasetAsync(
    IAsyncEnumerable<DataItem> dataStream,
    IProgress<ProcessProgress> progress = null,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    const int batchSize = 100;
    var semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(Environment.ProcessorCount);
    var result = new ProcessResult();
    var processedCount = 0;
    
    var batch = new List<DataItem>(batchSize);
    
    await foreach (var item in dataStream.WithCancellation(cancellationToken))
    {
        batch.Add(item);
        
        if (batch.Count >= batchSize)
        {
            await ProcessBatchAsync(batch, semaphore, result, cancellationToken);
            
            processedCount += batch.Count;
            progress?.Report(new ProcessProgress 
            { 
                ItemsProcessed = processedCount,
                CurrentOperation = "Processing batch"
            });
            
            batch.Clear();
        }
    }
    
    // Process remaining items
    if (batch.Count > 0)
    {
        await ProcessBatchAsync(batch, semaphore, result, cancellationToken);
    }
    
    return result;
}

private async Task ProcessBatchAsync(
    IReadOnlyList<DataItem> batch,
    SemaphoreSlim semaphore,
    ProcessResult result,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var tasks = batch.Select(async item =>
    {
        await semaphore.WaitAsync(cancellationToken);
        try
        {
            return await ProcessSingleItemAsync(item, cancellationToken);
        }
        finally
        {
            semaphore.Release();
        }
    });
    
    var results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
    
    foreach (var itemResult in results)
    {
        result.AddItem(itemResult);
    }
}
```

## Testing Asynchronous Code

### Unit Testing Patterns for Async Operations

#### Testing Basic Async Methods
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task ProcessDataAsync_WithValidData_ReturnsSuccess()
{
    // Arrange
    var testData = CreateTestData();
    var processor = new DataProcessor();
    
    // Act
    var result = await processor.ProcessDataAsync(testData);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.IsTrue(result.Success);
    Assert.AreEqual(testData.Count, result.ProcessedItems.Count);
}
```

#### Testing Cancellation Behavior
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task ProcessDataAsync_WithCancellation_ThrowsOperationCanceledException()
{
    // Arrange
    var testData = CreateLargeTestData();
    var processor = new DataProcessor();
    using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
    
    // Act & Assert
    var task = processor.ProcessDataAsync(testData, cancellationToken: cts.Token);
    cts.Cancel();
    
    await Assert.ThrowsAsync<OperationCanceledException>(() => task);
}
```

#### Testing Progress Reporting
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task ProcessDataAsync_WithProgress_ReportsProgress()
{
    // Arrange
    var testData = CreateTestData();
    var processor = new DataProcessor();
    var progressReports = new List<int>();
    var progress = new Progress<int>(p => progressReports.Add(p));
    
    // Act
    await processor.ProcessDataAsync(testData, progress);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.IsTrue(progressReports.Count > 0);
    Assert.AreEqual(100, progressReports.Last());
}
```

#### Testing Task Combinators
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task ProcessParallelAsync_WithMultipleSources_ProcessesAll()
{
    // Arrange
    var dataSources = CreateMultipleDataSources();
    var processor = new DataProcessor();
    
    // Act
    var results = await processor.ProcessParallelAsync(dataSources);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(dataSources.Count, results.Length);
    Assert.IsTrue(results.All(r => r.Success));
}
```

### Integration Testing Patterns

#### Testing with Real Dependencies
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task ProcessDataAsync_WithRealDatabase_HandlesErrors()
{
    // Arrange
    var processor = new DataProcessor(connectionString);
    var testData = CreateTestData();
    
    // Act & Assert
    var result = await processor.ProcessDataAsync(testData);
    
    if (result.Success)
    {
        // Verify data was saved
        var savedData = await processor.GetSavedDataAsync();
        Assert.AreEqual(testData.Count, savedData.Count);
    }
    else
    {
        // Verify error was handled properly
        Assert.IsNotNull(result.Error);
    }
}
```

### Debugging Asynchronous Code

#### Common Debugging Techniques
1. **Async Stack Traces**: Use debugging tools that support async stack traces
2. **Logging**: Add comprehensive logging to track async operation flow
3. **Breakpoint Placement**: Place breakpoints at await points and continuation points
4. **Task State Monitoring**: Monitor task states during debugging

#### Debugging Deadlocks
```csharp
// Bad - can cause deadlocks
public void BadSyncMethod()
{
    var result = SomeAsyncMethod().Result; // Blocks
}

// Good - proper async all the way
public async Task GoodAsyncMethod()
{
    var result = await SomeAsyncMethod();
}
```

## Advanced Patterns and Techniques

### Custom Awaitable Types
For specialized scenarios, you can create custom awaitable types:

```csharp
public struct CustomAwaitable
{
    public CustomAwaiter GetAwaiter() => new CustomAwaiter();
}

public struct CustomAwaiter : INotifyCompletion
{
    public bool IsCompleted { get; }
    public void OnCompleted(Action continuation) { /* Implementation */ }
    public void GetResult() { /* Implementation */ }
}
```

### Async Enumerable Patterns
For streaming data scenarios:

```csharp
public async IAsyncEnumerable<ProcessResult> ProcessStreamAsync(
    IAsyncEnumerable<DataItem> dataStream,
    [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    await foreach (var item in dataStream.WithCancellation(cancellationToken))
    {
        var result = await ProcessSingleItemAsync(item, cancellationToken);
        yield return result;
    }
}
```

### ValueTask for High-Performance Scenarios
When optimization is critical:

```csharp
public ValueTask<ProcessResult> ProcessCachedDataAsync(string key)
{
    if (_cache.TryGetValue(key, out var cachedResult))
    {
        // Return synchronously without allocation
        return new ValueTask<ProcessResult>(cachedResult);
    }
    
    // Return async task
    return new ValueTask<ProcessResult>(ProcessDataSlowAsync(key));
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Performance Monitoring
Monitor key metrics for async operations:

- **Task Creation Rate**: Number of tasks created per second
- **Task Completion Time**: Time from task creation to completion
- **Thread Pool Usage**: Active threads vs. available threads
- **Memory Pressure**: Memory usage patterns for async operations

### Logging Best Practices
```csharp
public async Task<ProcessResult> ProcessDataAsync(
    ProcessRequest request,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    using var activity = _activitySource.StartActivity("ProcessData");
    activity?.SetTag("request.id", request.Id);
    
    _logger.LogInformation("Starting data processing for request {RequestId}", request.Id);
    
    try
    {
        var result = await ProcessDataInternalAsync(request, cancellationToken);
        
        _logger.LogInformation("Completed data processing for request {RequestId} in {Duration}ms", 
            request.Id, activity?.Duration.TotalMilliseconds);
        
        return result;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error processing data for request {RequestId}", request.Id);
        throw;
    }
}
```

### Distributed Tracing
For microservices and distributed systems:

```csharp
public async Task<ProcessResult> ProcessDataAsync(
    ProcessRequest request,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    using var activity = Activity.StartActivity("ProcessData");
    activity?.SetTag("service.name", "DataProcessor");
    activity?.SetTag("request.size", request.Data.Length);
    
    // Propagate trace context to downstream services
    var httpClient = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
    var response = await httpClient.PostAsync("downstream-service", 
        CreateRequestContent(request), cancellationToken);
    
    return await ProcessResponseAsync(response, cancellationToken);
}
```

## Production Considerations

### Error Handling Strategy
Define a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **Transient Errors**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. **Permanent Errors**: Log and fail fast
3. **User Errors**: Provide meaningful error messages
4. **System Errors**: Alert monitoring systems

### Resource Management
Proper resource management is crucial:

```csharp
public class ResourceManager : IDisposable
{
    private readonly SemaphoreSlim _semaphore;
    private readonly CancellationTokenSource _shutdownCts;
    
    public ResourceManager(int maxConcurrency)
    {
        _semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(maxConcurrency);
        _shutdownCts = new CancellationTokenSource();
    }
    
    public async Task<T> ProcessWithResourceAsync<T>(
        Func<CancellationToken, Task<T>> processor,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        using var linkedCts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(
            cancellationToken, _shutdownCts.Token);
        
        await _semaphore.WaitAsync(linkedCts.Token);
        try
        {
            return await processor(linkedCts.Token);
        }
        finally
        {
            _semaphore.Release();
        }
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _shutdownCts?.Cancel();
        _semaphore?.Dispose();
        _shutdownCts?.Dispose();
    }
}
```

### Configuration and Tuning
Key configuration parameters for async operations:

```csharp
public class AsyncConfiguration
{
    public int MaxConcurrency { get; set; } = Environment.ProcessorCount;
    public TimeSpan DefaultTimeout { get; set; } = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
    public int MaxRetries { get; set; } = 3;
    public TimeSpan RetryDelay { get; set; } = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
    public bool EnableProgressReporting { get; set; } = true;
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Cancellation Pitfalls
- **Forgetting to check cancellation**: Always check `CancellationToken` in loops and long operations
- **Improper exception handling**: Don't catch and suppress `OperationCanceledException`
- **Resource leaks**: Ensure proper cleanup even when operations are cancelled
- **Deadlocks**: Avoid blocking on cancelled operations

### Progress Reporting Pitfalls
- **Thread safety issues**: Always use `IProgress<T>` instead of direct callback delegates
- **Performance impact**: Don't report progress too frequently
- **UI blocking**: Keep progress callbacks lightweight
- **Memory leaks**: Ensure progress callbacks don't hold references to large objects

### Task Combinator Pitfalls
- **Unhandled exceptions**: Check individual task states when using combinators
- **Resource leaks**: Clean up resources from tasks that don't complete
- **Incorrect exception handling**: Understand how exceptions are propagated
- **Performance issues**: Don't create excessive numbers of tasks
