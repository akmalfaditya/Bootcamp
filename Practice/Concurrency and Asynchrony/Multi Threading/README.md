## üöÄ Key Features with Examples

### Advanced Thread Creation
```csharp
// Named thread with custom delegate
Thread namedThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(DoWork))
{
    Name = "DataProcessor",
    IsBackground = true,
    Priority = ThreadPriority.AboveNormal
};
namedThread.Start();

// Parameterized thread with lambda
Thread paramThread = new Thread(data => {
    var workItem = (WorkItem)data;
    ProcessWorkItem(workItem);
});
paramThread.Start(new WorkItem { Id = 1, Data = "Test" });
```

### Semaphore Resource Management
```csharp
// Limit concurrent access to 3 threads
private static Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3, 3);

static void AccessLimitedResource()
{
    semaphore.WaitOne(); // Acquire permit
    try
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId} accessing resource");
        Thread.Sleep(2000); // Simulate work
    }
    finally
    {
        semaphore.Release(); // Release permit
    }
}
```

### Mutex Inter-Process Synchronization
```csharp
private static Mutex namedMutex = new Mutex(false, "MyAppMutex");

static void EnsureSingleInstance()
{
    try
    {
        if (namedMutex.WaitOne(TimeSpan.Zero, false))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Application started successfully");
            // Application logic here
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Another instance is already running");
            return;
        }
    }
    finally
    {
        namedMutex.ReleaseMutex();
    }
}
```

### Advanced Monitor Usage
```csharp
private static readonly object lockObject = new object();
private static Queue<WorkItem> workQueue = new Queue<WorkItem>();

static void WaitForWork()
{
    lock (lockObject)
    {
        while (workQueue.Count == 0)
        {
            Monitor.Wait(lockObject); // Release lock and wait
        }
        var item = workQueue.Dequeue();
        ProcessItem(item);
    }
}

static void AddWork(WorkItem item)
{
    lock (lockObject)
    {
        workQueue.Enqueue(item);
        Monitor.Pulse(lockObject); // Signal waiting thread
    }
}
```

### Deadlock Prevention Pattern
```csharp
private static readonly object lock1 = new object();
private static readonly object lock2 = new object();

// Always acquire locks in same order to prevent deadlock
static void SafeMethodA()
{
    lock (lock1)
    {
        Thread.Sleep(100);
        lock (lock2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method A completed safely");
        }
    }
}

static void SafeMethodB()
{
    lock (lock1) // Same order as Method A
    {
        Thread.Sleep(100);
        lock (lock2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method B completed safely");
        }
    }
}
```

## üí° Trainer Tips

### Performance Optimization
- **Thread Pool Usage**: Use ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem for short-lived tasks
- **Lock Granularity**: Use fine-grained locks to reduce contention
- **Avoid Frequent Allocation**: Reuse objects to reduce GC pressure in hot paths
- **CPU vs I/O Bound**: Choose appropriate threading strategies based on workload characteristics

### Deadlock Prevention Strategies
- **Consistent Lock Ordering**: Always acquire multiple locks in the same order
- **Timeout Usage**: Use Monitor.TryEnter with timeouts to detect potential deadlocks
- **Lock Scope Minimization**: Keep critical sections as small as possible
- **Lock-Free Algorithms**: Consider lock-free data structures for high-contention scenarios

### Debugging Multi-Threaded Applications
- **Thread Naming**: Always name threads for easier debugging
- **Logging Thread IDs**: Include thread IDs in log messages
- **Visual Studio Debugger**: Use Threads and Parallel Stacks windows
- **Stress Testing**: Test under heavy concurrent load to expose race conditions

```csharp
public class ProducerConsumerSystem
{
    private readonly Queue<WorkItem> _queue = new Queue<WorkItem>();
    private readonly object _lock = new object();
    private readonly AutoResetEvent _itemAvailable = new AutoResetEvent(false);
    private volatile bool _shutdown = false;

    public void Producer()
    {
        while (!_shutdown)
        {
            var item = GenerateWorkItem();
            lock (_lock)
            {
                _queue.Enqueue(item);
            }
            _itemAvailable.Set(); // Signal consumer
        }
    }

    public void Consumer()
    {
        while (!_shutdown)
        {
            _itemAvailable.WaitOne(); // Wait for work
            WorkItem item = null;
            
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_queue.Count > 0)
                    item = _queue.Dequeue();
            }
            
            if (item != null)
                ProcessWorkItem(item);
        }
    }
}
```

    public static ThreadSafeSingleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                lock (_lock)
                {
                    if (_instance == null)
                        _instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
                }
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

### üéØ Resource Pool Management
```csharp
public class ResourcePool<T> where T : class, new()
{
    private readonly Queue<T> _pool = new Queue<T>();
    private readonly Semaphore _semaphore;
    private readonly object _lock = new object();

    public ResourcePool(int maxSize)
    {
        _semaphore = new Semaphore(maxSize, maxSize);
        for (int i = 0; i < maxSize; i++)
        {
            _pool.Enqueue(new T());
        }
    }

    public T AcquireResource()
    {
        _semaphore.WaitOne(); // Wait for available resource
        lock (_lock)
        {
            return _pool.Dequeue();
        }
    }

    public void ReleaseResource(T resource)
    {
        lock (_lock)
        {
            _pool.Enqueue(resource);
        }
        _semaphore.Release(); // Signal available resource
    }
}
```
