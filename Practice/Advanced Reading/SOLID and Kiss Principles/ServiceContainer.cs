/*
 * ðŸ’¡ Key Benefits of This Approach:
 * 
 * 1. TESTABILITY: Easy to swap real services with mocks for testing
 * 2. FLEXIBILITY: Change implementations without changing business logic  
 * 3. MAINTAINABILITY: All dependencies configured in one place
 * 4. SEPARATION: Business logic doesn't know about concrete implementations
 * 5. SCALABILITY: Easy to add new services and dependencies
 * 
 * This is Dependency Inversion Principle in action!
