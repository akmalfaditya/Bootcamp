# Managed Memory Leaks in C# - Comprehensive Training Guide

## Introduction

This training project provides a comprehensive understanding of managed memory leaks in C#. While the Common Language Runtime (CLR) includes automatic garbage collection to prevent traditional memory leaks, modern .NET applications can still experience memory-related issues that require careful attention and proper coding practices.

## Understanding Managed Memory Leaks

### What Are Managed Memory Leaks?

In unmanaged languages such as C++, developers must manually allocate and deallocate memory. Failure to deallocate memory results in traditional memory leaks. In contrast, .NET applications benefit from automatic garbage collection, which prevents most memory leaks by automatically reclaiming unused objects.

However, managed memory leaks can still occur when objects remain alive longer than necessary due to unintended references. The garbage collector cannot reclaim objects that are still referenced by other objects, even if the application no longer needs them.

### The Root Cause

Managed memory leaks are fundamentally caused by forgotten or unintended references that prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming objects. The garbage collector uses a reachability algorithm that starts from "roots" (static variables, local variables on the stack, CPU registers) and marks all reachable objects. Objects that are not reachable from any root are eligible for collection.

When an object maintains a reference to another object that should be collected, it creates an unintended reference chain that keeps the target object alive, resulting in a memory leak.

## Core Concepts and Patterns

### 1. Event Handler Memory Leaks

Event handlers represent the most common source of memory leaks in C# applications. This pattern occurs because events create strong references from publishers to subscribers.

#### The Problem Mechanism

When an object subscribes to an event, the event publisher maintains a reference to the subscriber through its delegate list. This creates a two-way reference relationship:
- The subscriber holds a reference to the publisher
- The publisher holds a reference to the subscriber via the event delegate

The critical issue is that the publisher's reference to the subscriber prevents garbage collection, even after the subscriber goes out of scope in the calling code.

#### Example Scenario

Consider a Host class that publishes a Click event, and multiple Client objects that subscribe to this event:

```csharp
class Host
{
    public event EventHandler Click;
}

class Client
{
    public Client(Host host)
    {
        host.Click += HandleClick; // Creates strong reference
    }
    
    private void HandleClick(object sender, EventArgs e) { }
    // No unsubscribe mechanism - memory leak occurs here
}
```

When 1000 Client objects are created and subscribe to the Host's Click event, they remain in memory indefinitely because the Host maintains references to all of them through its event delegate list.

#### Solution Strategy

The recommended solution is to implement the IDisposable pattern and explicitly unsubscribe from events in the Dispose method:

```csharp
class Client : IDisposable
{
    private Host _host;
    
    public Client(Host host)
    {
        _host = host;
        _host.Click += HandleClick;
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _host.Click -= HandleClick; // Removes reference
    }
}
```

### 2. Timer Memory Leaks

Timer objects present another significant source of memory leaks, particularly with System.Timers.Timer instances.

#### System.Timers.Timer Reference Chain

The .NET runtime maintains strong references to active System.Timers.Timer instances to ensure they continue executing their callbacks. This creates a reference chain:

1. The .NET runtime holds references to active timers
2. Each timer holds references to objects that subscribe to its Elapsed event
3. These objects cannot be garbage collected while the timer remains active

#### The Problem Pattern

```csharp
class TimerOwner
{
    private System.Timers.Timer _timer;
    
    public TimerOwner()
    {
        _timer = new System.Timers.Timer(1000);
        _timer.Elapsed += OnTimerElapsed;
        _timer.Start();
    }
    
    private void OnTimerElapsed(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e) { }
    // No disposal - timer and owner stay alive indefinitely
}
```

#### Solution Approach

Implement IDisposable and properly dispose of timer resources:

```csharp
class TimerOwner : IDisposable
{
    private System.Timers.Timer _timer;
    
    public TimerOwner()
    {
        _timer = new System.Timers.Timer(1000);
        _timer.Elapsed += OnTimerElapsed;
        _timer.Start();
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _timer?.Dispose(); // Stops timer and releases runtime reference
    }
}
```

### 3. System.Threading.Timer Behavior

System.Threading.Timer exhibits different behavior compared to System.Timers.Timer, which can lead to unpredictable memory management.

#### Behavioral Differences

System.Threading.Timer instances are not held strongly by the runtime. Instead, the runtime maintains references to their callback delegates. This means that if no strong reference to the timer exists, it may be garbage collected prematurely, even while it should still be active.

#### The Unpredictability Issue

```csharp
static void CreateTimer()
{
    var timer = new System.Threading.Timer(Callback, null, 1000, 1000);
    // Timer may be collected immediately in release mode
}
```

In release mode with optimizations enabled, the timer variable may be eligible for garbage collection immediately after creation, causing the timer to stop functioning unexpectedly.

#### Recommended Solution

Use the using statement to ensure predictable lifetime management:

```csharp
static void CreateTimer()
{
    using (var timer = new System.Threading.Timer(Callback, null, 1000, 1000))
    {
        // Timer guaranteed to remain alive within this scope
        Thread.Sleep(10000);
    } // Timer disposed automatically
}
```

### 4. Static Reference Memory Leaks

Static fields and collections represent permanent roots in the garbage collection graph, making any objects they reference ineligible for collection.

#### The Static Collection Problem

Static collections accumulate objects over time without any mechanism for removal:

```csharp
public static class Cache
{
    private static List<object> _items = new List<object>();
    
    public static void Add(object item)
    {
        _items.Add(item); // Object can never be collected
    }
}
```

Objects added to static collections remain in memory for the entire application lifetime because static fields themselves are never garbage collected.

#### Memory Management Strategy

Implement explicit management policies for static collections:

```csharp
public static class Cache
{
    private static List<object> _items = new List<object>();
    
    public static void Add(object item)
    {
        _items.Add(item);
        
        // Implement size limit
        if (_items.Count > 1000)
        {
            _items.RemoveAt(0); // Remove oldest item
        }
    }
    
    public static void Clear()
    {
        _items.Clear(); // Explicit cleanup
    }
}
```

### 5. Weak References as Solutions

Weak references provide a mechanism to reference objects without preventing their garbage collection.

#### Understanding Weak References

A weak reference allows you to access an object while permitting the garbage collector to reclaim it when no strong references exist:

```csharp
var target = new ExpensiveObject();
var weakRef = new WeakReference(target);

target = null; // Remove strong reference

if (weakRef.IsAlive)
{
    var recovered = weakRef.Target;
    // Use recovered object
}
```

#### Weak Event Pattern

Weak references are particularly useful in event patterns where you want to avoid keeping subscribers alive:

```csharp
public class WeakEventManager
{
    private static List<WeakReference> _subscribers = new List<WeakReference>();
    
    public static void Subscribe(object subscriber)
    {
        _subscribers.Add(new WeakReference(subscriber));
    }
    
    public static void Publish(string message)
    {
        for (int i = _subscribers.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            if (_subscribers[i].IsAlive)
            {
                // Notify subscriber
            }
            else
            {
                _subscribers.RemoveAt(i); // Clean up dead reference
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. Proper Cleanup Patterns

Implementing consistent cleanup patterns prevents most memory leaks and resource issues.

#### The IDisposable Pattern

The IDisposable interface provides a standard mechanism for resource cleanup:

```csharp
public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed = false;
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
    
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Clean up managed resources
            }
            
            // Clean up unmanaged resources
            _disposed = true;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using Statement Pattern

The using statement ensures automatic disposal:

```csharp
using (var resource = new ResourceHolder())
{
    // Use resource
} // Dispose called automatically
```

#### Resource Pooling

For expensive objects, consider implementing resource pooling:

```csharp
public class ResourcePool<T> where T : IDisposable, new()
{
    private readonly Queue<T> _pool = new Queue<T>();
    
    public T Rent()
    {
        if (_pool.Count > 0)
            return _pool.Dequeue();
        
        return new T();
    }
    
    public void Return(T item)
    {
        _pool.Enqueue(item);
    }
}
```

## Memory Diagnostics and Monitoring

### Proactive Memory Monitoring

Implement memory monitoring during development to catch leaks early:

```csharp
long memoryBefore = GC.GetTotalMemory(false);
// Perform operations
long memoryAfter = GC.GetTotalMemory(true); // Force collection
Console.WriteLine($"Memory change: {memoryAfter - memoryBefore} bytes");
```

### Profiling Tools

Several tools can help identify memory leaks:

- **Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools**: Built-in profiling capabilities
- **dotMemory**: Commercial profiler with detailed heap analysis
- **PerfView**: Free Microsoft tool for advanced profiling
- **Application Insights**: Production monitoring capabilities

### Unit Testing for Memory Leaks

Write tests that verify proper cleanup:

```csharp
[Test]
public void TestEventHandlerCleanup()
{
    var publisher = new EventPublisher();
    var initialMemory = GC.GetTotalMemory(true);
    
    // Create and dispose subscribers
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        using (var subscriber = new ProperEventSubscriber(publisher))
        {
            // Use subscriber
        }
    }
    
    GC.Collect();
    var finalMemory = GC.GetTotalMemory(true);
    
    Assert.IsTrue(finalMemory - initialMemory < threshold);
}
```

## Best Practices Summary

### Memory Leak Prevention Guidelines

1. **Event Management**: Always unsubscribe from events in disposal methods
2. **Resource Disposal**: Implement IDisposable for classes that hold disposable resources
3. **Static Collection Management**: Implement size limits and cleanup policies
4. **Timer Lifecycle**: Always dispose timer objects when finished
5. **Weak References**: Use for observer patterns and caches
6. **Using Statements**: Prefer using statements for automatic resource management

### Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code for potential memory leaks, check for:

- Event subscriptions without corresponding unsubscriptions
- Timer creations without disposal
- Static collections without cleanup mechanisms
- IDisposable implementations without proper disposal
- Resource acquisitions without using statements

### Performance Monitoring

In production environments, monitor:

- Total managed memory usage over time
- Garbage collection frequency and duration
- Object allocation rates
- Memory pressure indicators

## Conclusion

Understanding and preventing managed memory leaks requires awareness of reference relationships, proper implementation of disposal patterns, and consistent application of best practices. By following the patterns and guidelines demonstrated in this project, developers can create robust applications that maintain stable memory usage over extended periods.

Regular profiling, proactive monitoring, and adherence to established patterns will help ensure that applications remain performant and reliable in production environments.

# Run the demonstration
dotnet run
```

The program will run each memory leak scenario and show you:
- **Memory before** creating objects
- **Memory after** creating objects
- **Memory after** attempting cleanup
- **Analysis** of what happened and why

## What You'll See in the Output

Each demonstration shows memory usage in bytes and explains:

1. **The Setup** - What objects are being created
2. **The Problem** - Why memory isn't being freed
3. **The Solution** - How to fix the leak
4. **The Proof** - Memory measurements showing the difference

## Key Learning Points

### Bad Patterns (Memory Leaks)
```csharp
// Subscribing without unsubscribing
publisher.SomeEvent += MyHandler;
// Object can't be garbage collected!

// Creating timers without disposal
var timer = new System.Timers.Timer(1000);
// Timer keeps callbacks alive forever!

// Growing static collections
static List<object> cache = new List<object>();
cache.Add(someObject); // Never removed!
```

### Good Patterns (Proper Cleanup)
```csharp
// Always unsubscribe
publisher.SomeEvent += MyHandler;
// Later...
publisher.SomeEvent -= MyHandler;

// Dispose timers properly
using var timer = new System.Timers.Timer(1000);
// Automatically disposed!

// Implement proper cache eviction
// Remove expired items regularly
// Use weak references when appropriate
```

## Tips

1. **Use Memory Profilers**: Tools like dotMemory or PerfView will show you exactly what's keeping objects alive.

2. **Watch Static Collections**: Any static `List<>`, `Dictionary<>`, or custom collection is a potential leak source.

3. **Events Are Dangerous**: The biggest source of memory leaks in C# applications. Always pair subscribe with unsubscribe.

4. **Timers Need Love**: Both `System.Timers.Timer` and `System.Threading.Timer` need explicit disposal.

5. **Weak References**: Use them for observer patterns and caches where you don't want to control object lifetime.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to unsubscribe from events** - especially in UI applications
2. **Not disposing timers** - they keep running even when you don't need them
3. **Growing static collections indefinitely** - implement size limits and eviction
4. **Assuming garbage collection will handle everything** - it only cleans up unreferenced objects
5. **Not understanding object lifetime** - know when objects should die
