# Equality Comparison in C#

## Overview

Equality comparison is one of the most fundamental yet complex aspects of C# programming. This project provides a comprehensive exploration of how equality works in the .NET framework, covering everything from basic value comparisons to advanced custom implementations. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing correct, efficient, and maintainable C# code.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this project, you will gain a thorough understanding of:

- The fundamental difference between value equality and reference equality
- How the equality operator (`==`) behaves differently across various types
- The role of the virtual `Equals()` method and when to use it
- Proper null handling strategies in equality comparisons
- Performance implications of different equality implementations
- Best practices for implementing custom equality logic
- Modern C# features like records and their automatic equality behavior

## Core Concepts Explained

### 1. Value vs Reference Equality

**Value Equality** occurs when two objects are considered equal based on their content or state, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory. **Reference Equality** occurs when two references point to exactly the same object instance.

**Key Points:**
- Value types (int, DateTime, structs) use value equality by default
- Reference types (classes) use reference equality by default
- Some reference types like string override this behavior
- Boxing can create unexpected behavior with value types

**Example Scenario:**
```csharp
int x = 5, y = 5;
Console.WriteLine(x == y); // True - same values

object boxedX = 5, boxedY = 5;
Console.WriteLine(boxedX == boxedY); // False - different objects!
```

### 2. The Equality Operator (== and !=)

The equality operators are **statically resolved** at compile time, meaning the compiler determines which implementation to use based on the declared types of the operands.

**Key Points:**
- Operators are resolved at compile time, not runtime
- Different types may override these operators differently
- Boxing can cause unexpected results
- String and Uri types override `==` for value equality

**Critical Understanding:**
When you cast objects to different types, the behavior of `==` can change because the compiler uses the type information available at compile time.

### 3. The Virtual Equals Method

The `Equals()` method is **dynamically resolved** at runtime, making it more flexible than the equality operators for polymorphic scenarios.

**Key Points:**
- Virtual method resolved at runtime
- Works correctly with inheritance and polymorphism
- Handles boxed value types properly
- Can throw NullReferenceException if called on null

**Best Practice:**
Use `Equals()` when you need runtime type resolution or when working with polymorphic code.

### 4. Object.Equals Static Method

This static method provides **null-safe equality comparison** and is the recommended approach when dealing with potentially null values.

**Key Points:**
- Handles null values gracefully without throwing exceptions
- Uses the virtual Equals method internally when objects are not null
- Essential for defensive programming
- Particularly useful in generic scenarios

**Usage Pattern:**
```csharp
// Safe - never throws NullReferenceException
bool result = Object.Equals(obj1, obj2);
```

### 5. Null Handling Strategies

Proper null handling is crucial for robust equality comparisons, as null reference exceptions are a common source of runtime errors.

**Key Strategies:**
- Always check for null before calling instance methods
- Use Object.Equals for null-safe comparisons
- Implement proper null handling in custom equality methods
- Understand nullable reference types in modern C#

### 6. String Equality Special Cases

Strings have unique equality behavior due to **string interning** and **cultural considerations**.

**Key Points:**
- String literals are automatically interned
- Runtime-constructed strings may not be interned
- Cultural comparison options affect equality results
- Case sensitivity and normalization considerations

**Important Distinction:**
```csharp
string.Equals(s1, s2, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase); // Culture-neutral
string.Equals(s1, s2, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase); // Culture-specific
```

### 7. When Equals and == Behave Differently

There are specific scenarios where the `Equals()` method and `==` operator intentionally produce different results.

**Classic Examples:**
- **double.NaN**: `==` returns false (IEEE 754 standard), `Equals()` returns true (reflexive requirement)
- **StringBuilder**: `==` uses reference equality, `Equals()` uses value equality

**Why This Matters:**
Collections rely on the reflexive property of `Equals()` to function correctly, so `obj.Equals(obj)` must always return true.

### 8. Custom Value Type Equality

When implementing equality for structs, you need to override both `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()`, and often implement `IEquatable<T>` for performance.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
public struct MyStruct : IEquatable<MyStruct>
{
    public bool Equals(MyStruct other) { /* type-safe implementation */ }
    public override bool Equals(object obj) { /* boxing-safe implementation */ }
    public override int GetHashCode() { /* consistent with Equals */ }
    public static bool operator ==(MyStruct left, MyStruct right) { /* convenience */ }
    public static bool operator !=(MyStruct left, MyStruct right) { /* convenience */ }
}
```

### 9. Custom Reference Type Equality

For classes, you can override the default reference equality to implement value-based equality when it makes logical sense.

**Key Considerations:**
- Override `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` together
- Handle null values properly
- Consider whether to override `==` operators
- Implement `IEquatable<T>` for performance

### 10. IEquatable<T> Interface

This generic interface provides **type-safe equality comparison** without boxing overhead for value types.

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates boxing for value types in generic collections
- Provides compile-time type safety
- Improves performance in equality-heavy operations
- Required for optimal performance with generic collections

### 11. Hash Code Implementation

The relationship between `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` is governed by a strict contract that must be followed for hash-based collections to work correctly.

**Hash Code Contract:**
- If `obj1.Equals(obj2)` is true, then `obj1.GetHashCode()` must equal `obj2.GetHashCode()`
- Hash codes should be stable during an object's lifetime
- Hash codes should distribute values evenly to minimize collisions

**Critical Rule:**
Always base your hash code calculation on the same fields used in your equality comparison.

### 12. Modern C# Records

Records (introduced in C# 9) provide **automatic structural equality** implementation, eliminating much of the boilerplate code required for value-based equality.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic implementation of equality members
- Value-based equality by default
- Immutable by default
- Support for custom equality when needed

## Real-World Applications

### Entity Framework and ORM Scenarios
In data access layers, proper equality implementation enables:
- Efficient entity tracking and change detection
- Correct behavior in LINQ queries
- Proper functioning of navigation properties

### Collection Operations
Equality is fundamental to:
- HashSet and Dictionary operations
- LINQ operations like Distinct, Union, and Contains
- List operations like IndexOf and Contains

### Caching Systems
Cache implementations rely on:
- Consistent hash codes for key distribution
- Proper equality for cache key comparison
- Immutable equality properties

### Testing and Assertions
Unit tests depend on:
- Predictable equality behavior
- Proper null handling
- Consistent comparison results

## Performance Considerations

### Generic Collections
- Implement `IEquatable<T>` to avoid boxing in generic collections
- Use consistent hash code implementation for optimal hash table performance
- Consider the cost of equality operations in hot paths

### String Comparisons
- Choose appropriate `StringComparison` options
- Understand the performance implications of cultural comparisons
- Use ordinal comparisons when cultural sensitivity is not required

### Memory Allocation
- Struct equality can avoid heap allocations
- Boxing can create unexpected garbage collection pressure
- Consider readonly structs for immutable value types
